# HyperOS Tweaker (Debloat & Battery Saver)

**HyperOS Tweaker** is a Magisk module that removes unnecessary system bloatware from Xiaomiâ€™s **HyperOS**, optimizing it for **faster performance**, **better RAM management**, and **extended battery life** while maintaining smooth operation.

## Features:
- **System Debloating**: Disables and removes unwanted pre-installed apps such as:
  - Mi Browser
  - App Vault
  - MIUI System Ads (MSA)
  - Mi Share
  - Cleaner
  - Mi Credit
  - Mi Pay
  - and more...
  
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - CPU governor settings set to "performance" mode.
  - Cache clearing to free up memory.
  - Reduced system resource usage by removing background services.
  
- **Battery Saver Tweaks**:
  - Adjusts system settings to maximize battery life while keeping performance high.
  - Enables low-power mode without compromising responsiveness.

- **Memory Management**:
  - Fine-tuned kernel parameters for optimal RAM usage.
  - Improved swappiness and cache pressure to reduce memory lag.

## How It Works:
This Magisk module makes use of systemless modifications, which means it disables and removes bloatware **without altering your system partition**. It applies optimizations during boot, ensuring your device runs faster and more efficiently with each startup.

## Requirements:
- Xiaomi device running **HyperOS** or **MIUI** (based on Android).
- Magisk installed with root access.

## Installation:
1. Download the module `.zip` file.
2. Open **Magisk Manager**.
3. Tap on **Modules**, then select **Install from Storage**.
4. Choose the downloaded `.zip` file.
5. Reboot your device after installation.

## Uninstallation:
- Simply disable the module in Magisk Manager and reboot, or completely remove the module by tapping the trash icon next to it.

## Disclaimer:
This module removes system apps and services, so ensure you do not rely on any of the apps being removed. Some features (like Mi Pay or Mi Cloud) may not work after debloating. Use at your own risk.
